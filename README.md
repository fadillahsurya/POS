I created a Food Store Management System built with Laravel and styled using Bootstrap. 
The application is designed to handle multiple user roles, including Cashier, Admin, Supplier, Partner (Mitra), and Customer.

The system provides an e-commerce-like experience where Customers and Partners can browse and purchase products directly through the platform.
A payment gateway integration ensures secure and seamless transactions. 
Meanwhile, the Admin and Cashier can manage sales, inventory, and reports, while Suppliers can monitor and supply goods efficiently.

This project demonstrates how Laravel can be combined with Bootstrap to deliver a responsive, role-based application that supports both store operations and online transactions in one platform.
